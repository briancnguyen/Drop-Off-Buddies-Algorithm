# Drop-Off Optimization Algorithm

## Problem Statement
Brian and his friends are chilling at his home late at night. Brian offers to drive and drop his friends off closer to their homes so that they can get back home safe at night.
Since the roads in his area are long, Brian would also like to get back home as soon as as he can. Can you plan transportation so that everyone can get home as efficiently as possible?
